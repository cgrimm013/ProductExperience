    This semester, I chose to focus on confidence. At the beginning I emphasized a little bit about confidence in the priesthood, but then branched out to focus mainly just on the attribute.

    There are primarily three parts to each weeks report:
  </h3>
  <br />
  <ol class="list">
    <li>
      The lesson I learned from studying talks or just other thoughts related to confidence.
    </li>
    <li>
      My own personal idea on how I could apply that thought for the coming week.
    </li>
    <li>
      A picture from my mission that reminds me of or relates to what I learned.
    </li>
  </ol>
